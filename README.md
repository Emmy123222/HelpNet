*"In times of need, people often turn to their communities for help. But what if the community could transcend borders and barriers, empowered by technology to help anyone, anywhere, at any time?"*

When crowdfunding first emerged, it promised to bridge gaps, empower creators, and bring dreams to life. Yet, over time, many platforms have fallen short of their promise, plagued by high fees, lack of transparency, and inefficiencies in fund allocation.

## The Painful Problem

Despite the growing need for crowdfunding, existing platforms face significant challenges:

- **High Platform Fees:** Many platforms charge up to 5-10%, cutting into funds meant for creators.
- **Lack of Trust:** Donors often worry about fund misuse and lack of transparency.
- **Campaign Frustration:** Creators face hurdles like inadequate vetting, delayed fund releases, and limited accountability.

For individuals and communities, these obstacles have turned crowdfunding into a source of frustration instead of empowerment.

## The Solution: HelpNet

**HelpNet** is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on **Starknet**, designed to restore trust, transparency, and fairness. Leveraging blockchain technology and community-driven governance, HelpNet ensures every campaign and transaction aligns with its mission: *for the community, by the community.*

Core features like DAO governance, milestone-based fund releases, and wallet-based KYC create a platform that empowers donors and creators alike while prioritizing trust and accountability.

## What We‚Äôve Built (MVP)

For our MVP, we‚Äôve implemented the following features:

1. **Register and Connect Wallet (KYC with Onfido):**  
   Seamless wallet-based KYC ensures secure and trustworthy participation.

2. **Browse Campaigns:**  
   Users can explore a curated list of ongoing campaigns and choose to support them.

3. **Support Campaigns Directly:**  
   Donors can contribute to campaigns they resonate with, even if they don‚Äôt create their own.

4. **Create Campaigns:**  
   Creators can submit campaigns, with a success pop-up confirming submission and awaiting DAO approval.

5. **DAO Voting:**  
   Campaigns undergo DAO member voting, where the community decides on approval or rejection.

6. **Donor Support for Approved Campaigns:**  
   Donors can confidently support campaigns once approved by the DAO.

## Challenges Faced

- **Internet Service Providers:**  
  Limited access to stable internet services in our home country created significant development and communication challenges.

- **Power Supply Issues:**  
  Inconsistent electricity made it difficult to sustain long working hours, especially during critical development phases.

- **Wallet-Based KYC Integration:**  
  Starknet currently lacks a native wallet-based KYC solution. To meet our hackathon goals, we integrated Onfido as a temporary alternative.

- **Time Constraints:**  
  Building a functional MVP within a week required prioritizing essential features.

- **Learning Curve:**  
  Adapting to Starknet's ecosystem presented unique challenges for our team.
